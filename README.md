# 🏎️ Formula 1 Data Engineering with Azure Databricks & Spark

## 📌 Project Overview
This project applies **advanced data engineering techniques** using **Azure Databricks and Spark** to process and analyze **Formula 1 racing data**. The goal is to design and implement a **scalable cloud-based data solution** while leveraging **modern data architectures** like **Delta Lake and the Lakehouse model**.

## 🚀 Key Features & Technologies

✅ **Azure Databricks** – Workspace setup, cluster management, and performance tuning.  
✅ **PySpark & Spark SQL** – ETL pipelines for data ingestion, transformation, and querying.  
✅ **Lakehouse Architecture with Delta Lake** – Implemented **time travel, versioning, and GDPR compliance** using Delta tables.  
✅ **Azure Key Vault & Databricks Secrets** – Secure handling of credentials and sensitive data.  
✅ **Data Governance with Azure Data Factory & Unity Catalog** – Seamless orchestration and governance of data workflows.  
✅ **Power BI Integration** – Interactive dashboards for real-time Formula 1 analytics.
